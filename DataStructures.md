At a high level, there are basically three types of data structures. 
- Stacks and Queues are array-like structures that differ only in how items are inserted and removed. 
- Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs are structures with nodes that keep references to other nodes. 
- Hash Tables depend on hash functions to save and locate data.

In terms of complexity, 
- Stacks and Queues are the simplest and can be constructed from Linked Lists. 
- Trees and Graphs are the most complex because they extend the concept of a linked list. 
- Hash Tables need to utilize these data structures to perform reliably. 

In terms of efficiency, 
- Linked Lists are most optimal for recording and storing of data, 
- Hash Tables are most performant for searching and retrieving of data.
