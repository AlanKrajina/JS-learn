### Creating a table and inserting data

```js
/** Grocery list: 
Bananas (4)
Peanut Butter (1)
Dark Chocolate Bars (2)
**/

CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER );

INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (3, "Dark chocolate bars", 2);
```

### Querying the table

```js
CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4, 7);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(2, "Peanut Butter", 1, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(3, "Dark Chocolate Bars", 2, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(4, "Ice cream", 1, 12);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(5, "Cherries", 6, 2);
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES(6, "Chocolate syrup", 1, 4);

SELECT * FROM groceries ORDER BY aisle;                      // order ascending by aisle


id	name	              quantity	aisle
2	Peanut Butter	     1     	2
3	Dark Chocolate Bars	2	     2
5	Cherries	          6	     2
6	Chocolate syrup	1	     4
1	Bananas	          4	     7
4	Ice cream	          1	     12


SELECT * FROM groceries WHERE aisle > 5 ORDER BY aisle;      // order ascending by aisle WHERE aisle > 5

id	name	     quantity	aisle
1	Bananas	    4	7
4	Ice cream	    1	12
```

### Aggregating data

```js
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM groceries;             // sum up all rows in guantity column

SUM(quantity)
15


SELECT MAX(quantity) FROM groceries;             // return biggest numb

SUM(quantity)
6


SELECT aisle, SUM(quantity) FROM groceries GROUP BY aisle;     // returns ALL aisles + SUM of Quantity for EACH aisle with SAME NUMBER

aisle	SUM(quantity)
2	      9
4	      1
7	      4
12	      1

```

### Complex queries with AND/OR

```js
CREATE TABLE exercise_logs
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER, 
    calories INTEGER,
    heart_rate INTEGER);


INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 30, 100, 110);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 10, 30, 105);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("dancing", 15, 200, 120);


SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 AND minutes < 30;         /* AND */

id	type	     minutes	calories	heart_rate
3	dancing	15	       200	120


SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 OR heart_rate > 100;      /* OR */

id	type	     minutes	calories	heart_rate
1	biking	30	       100	110
2	biking	10	        30	105
3	dancing	15	       200	120
```

### Querying IN subqueries

```js
// instead of using:

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type = "biking" OR type = "hiking" OR type = "tree climbing" OR type = "rowing";

// we use IN:

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");

// reverse of IN -> NOT IN

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type NOT IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");
```


EXAMPLE - 2 tables:
```js
// To finish creating the 'Pop' playlist, add another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists. It should use IN on a nested subquery that's based on your previous query.


SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist = 'Queen';

SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = 'Pop';

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist IN (SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop" AND name = artist);

// returns TITLE from SONGS where ARTIST in artist table has genre 'Pop' and name MATHING to TITLE from songs
```

##### INNER QUERY (subquery)

```js
CREATE TABLE drs_favorites
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    reason TEXT);

INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("biking", "Improves endurance and flexibility.");
INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("hiking", "Increases cardiovascular health.");



SELECT type FROM drs_favorites;

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites);             // inner query, returns ALL from exercise_logs that MATCH TYPE from drs_favorites


SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason = "Increases cardiovascular health");   // more specific return based on TYPE AND REASON
    
    
/* LIKE */

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");   // returns all with KEYWORD

```


## SQL Tutorial

### Querying data from a table

Query data in columns c1, c2 from a table

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```

##### Query all rows and columns from a table

```
SELECT * FROM t;
```

##### Query data and filter rows with a condition

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE condition;
```

##### Query distinct rows from a table

```
SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t
WHERE condition;
```

##### Sort the result set in ascending or descending order

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1 ASC [DESC];
```

##### Skip offset of rows and return the next n rows

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
ORDER BY c1 
LIMIT n OFFSET offset;
```

##### Group rows using an aggregate function

```
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2)
FROM t
GROUP BY c1;
```

##### Filter groups using HAVING clause

```
SELECT c1, aggregate(c2)
FROM t
GROUP BY c1
HAVING condition;
```

### Querying from multiple tables

##### Inner join t1 and t2

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

##### Left join t1 and t1

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
LEFT JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

##### Right join t1 and t2

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
RIGHT JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

##### Perform full outer join

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON condition;
```

##### Produce a Cartesian product of rows in tables

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1
CROSS JOIN t2;
```

##### Another way to perform cross join

```
SELECT c1, c2 
FROM t1, t2;
```

##### Join t1 to itself using INNER JOIN clause

```
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t1 A
INNER JOIN t2 B ON condition;
```

### Using SQL Operators

##### Combine rows from two queries

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
UNION [ALL]
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```

##### Return the intersection of two queries

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
INTERSECT
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```

##### Subtract a result set from another result set

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
MINUS
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
```

##### Query rows using pattern matching %, _

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1
WHERE c1 [NOT] LIKE pattern;
```

##### Query rows in a list

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE c1 [NOT] IN value_list;
```

##### Query rows between two values

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE  c1 BETWEEN low AND high;
```

##### Check if values in a table is NULL or not

```
SELECT c1, c2 FROM t
WHERE  c1 IS [NOT] NULL;
```

### Managing tables

##### Create a new table with three columns

```
CREATE TABLE t (
     id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
     price INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

##### Delete the table from the database

```
DROP TABLE t ;
```

##### Add a new column to the table

```
ALTER TABLE t ADD column;
```

##### Drop column c from the table

```
ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c ;
```

##### Add a constraint

```
ALTER TABLE t ADD constraint;
```

##### Drop a constraint

```
ALTER TABLE t DROP constraint;
```

##### Rename a table from t1 to t2

```
ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME TO t2;
```

##### Rename column c1 to c2

```
ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME c1 TO c2 ;
```

##### Remove all data in a table

```
TRUNCATE TABLE t;
```

### Using SQL constraints

##### Set c1 and c2 as a primary key

```
CREATE TABLE t(
    c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 VARCHAR,
    PRIMARY KEY (c1,c2)
);
```

##### Set c2 column as a foreign key

```
CREATE TABLE t1(
    c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,  
    c2 INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (c2) REFERENCES t2(c2)
);
```

##### Make the values in c1 and c2 unique

```
CREATE TABLE t(
    c1 INT, c1 INT,
    UNIQUE(c2,c3)
);
```

##### Ensure c1 > 0 and values in c1 >= c2

```
CREATE TABLE t(
  c1 INT, c2 INT,
  CHECK(c1> 0 AND c1 >= c2)
);
```

##### Set values in c2 column not NULL

```
CREATE TABLE t(
     c1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
     c2 VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```

### Modifying Data

##### Insert one row into a table

```
INSERT INTO t(column_list)
VALUES(value_list);
```

##### Insert multiple rows into a table

```
INSERT INTO t(column_list)
VALUES (value_list), 
       (value_list), â€¦;
```

##### Insert rows from t2 into t1

```
INSERT INTO t1(column_list)
SELECT column_list
FROM t2;
```

##### Update new value in the column c1 for all rows

```
UPDATE t
SET c1 = new_value;
```

##### Update values in the column c1, c2 that match the condition

```
UPDATE t
SET c1 = new_value, 
        c2 = new_value
WHERE condition;
```

##### Delete all data in a table

```
DELETE FROM t;
```

##### Delete subset of rows in a table

```
DELETE FROM t
WHERE condition;
```

### Managing Views

##### Create a new view that consists  of c1 and c2

```
CREATE VIEW v(c1,c2) 
AS
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t;
```

##### Create a new view with check option

```
CREATE VIEW v(c1,c2) 
AS
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t;
WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION;
```

##### Create a recursive view

```
CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW v 
AS
select-statement -- anchor part
UNION [ALL]
select-statement; -- recursive part
```

##### Create a temporary view

```
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW v 
AS
SELECT c1, c2
FROM t;
```

##### Delete a view

```
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

### Managing indexes

##### Create an index on c1 and c2 of the t table

```
CREATE INDEX idx_name 
ON t(c1,c2);
```

##### Create a unique index on c3, c4 of the t table

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name
ON t(c3,c4)
```

##### Drop an index

```
DROP INDEX idx_name;
```

### Managing triggers

##### Create or modify a trigger

```
CREATE OR MODIFY TRIGGER trigger_name
WHEN EVENT
ON table_name TRIGGER_TYPE
EXECUTE stored_procedure;
```

WHEN

  BEFORE â€“ invoke before the event occurs
  AFTER â€“ invoke after the event occurs

EVENT

  INSERT â€“ invoke for INSERT
  UPDATE â€“ invoke for UPDATE
  DELETE â€“ invoke for DELETE

TRIGGER_TYPE

  FOR EACH ROW
  FOR EACH STATEMENT

##### Delete a specific trigger

```
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```
